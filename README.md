This simple rotation script makes doors rotate at any angle in any direction. To use it, please import the scripts into Unity and then attach them to the same or separate objects.
Then, Select the axis to be rotated in the Rotate Open Script. Make the targetx, Targety, and Targetz the rotation of the object. Then, in the rotate manager, could you make the attached game object the door you want to rotate? Assign the openr and closer to the opened angle and closed angle. Toggle closable and make sure lock is not checked.
Here is a demonstration with simple cooking assets on Unity.
